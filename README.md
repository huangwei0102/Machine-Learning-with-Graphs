# 1. Introduction
This repo summarizes papers I've read for machine learning on graphs.

# 2. Requirement
I use basic packages from Anaconda3 with Python 3.8.5. To make my life easier, I also use the following packages to implement models:
```
torch==1.7.0
torch_geometric==1.6.3
```
# 3. Papers
The following are papers that I'll cover in this repo.
